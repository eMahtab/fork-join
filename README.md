# Fork Join

The fork/join framework provides support for parallel programming by splitting up a task into smaller tasks to process them using the available CPU cores.

In fact, Java 8's parallel streams and the method Arrays#parallelSort use under the hood the fork/join framework to execute parallel tasks.
